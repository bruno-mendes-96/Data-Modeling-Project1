# Udacity - Project 1

<h1> Project: Data Modeling with Postgres </h1>

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In this context, a datawarehouse allows you to store data reliably and securely, while allowing greater agility in data analysis for business decision making.

An ETL pipeline was developed to extract, transform and load the JSONs into an relational database.
The collected data was processed and stored in the form of a star schema, allowing the business team to be able to analyze the songs heard by the customers using SQL queries.
